        <p>Hello there! Are you trying to figure out how much money you should be spending a month? well you have come to just the right place.</p>
        <p>
            &emsp; Many places only specify how much of your income should be spent on rent which is normally around 30% of what you make monthly.
            According to some source you should be spending 50% of your monthly income on your needs which would be things like rent, groceries, 
            car payments, childcare, etc. So now that you have all of your needs met that means the rest of what you have can be used for whatever,
            right? Well not quite 20% of your income should be used on debts or set aside for an emergency fund and your retirement(401k or other 
            retirement accounts) and long term goals(new car or down payment). Some say you should save a little more but that may depend on how 
            much you make and the amount of debt you are in along with how much you are willing to set aside. This leaves you with 30% of your 
            income to use on your wants. This would be things like vacations, movies, gym memberships, videos games, or whatever you like to do 
            to make life a little more enjoyable.
